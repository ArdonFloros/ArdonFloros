Hello, my name is Ardon Floros.
I am currently a sophomore Computer Science major studying at Purdue University, which I plan to graduate from in the spring of 2026.

I am currently looking for a summer research or internship opportunity. I am most interested in robotics and machine learning. Because I plan to graduate in three years, I would like to gain as much experience as possible before entering the job search when I graduate.

You can contact me through email at ardonflorossba@gmail.com.
